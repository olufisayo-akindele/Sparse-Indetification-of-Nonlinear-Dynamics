# Sparse-Indetification-of-Nonlinear-Dynamics
This code is for a thesis and it uses the SINDy algorithm to discover dynamical systems models that describe the COVID-19 Data. The SINDy algorithm is a new machine learning algorithm that can help with predicting of future data and produce equations that best describe the system being studied.
The SINDy method uses the sequential threshold least-square method to discover these equations. This method uses list square fitting, thresholding and iteration to extract the systems model.
The parameters used in processing the data were optimised to give the best result and a model accuracy of 0.98 was achieved, the discovered model parameter when used along with short time frame of date was able to predict future values with an accuracy of up to 0.75 when only about half of the data was used in discovering the system model.
The SINDy model if utilised properly can be used to extract system models from very complex systems with several dimensions and discover the hidden dynamics within these systems. The SINDy algorithm can be applied to future pandemic outbreaks and to help understand the consequence of introducing certain countermeasures to mitigate a disease spread.
